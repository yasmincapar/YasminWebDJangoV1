===================
Django comes with a lot of features 
gives us a admin site
has ORM 
Django framework for building web applications in python
front end,client
backend,server
puts URL in browser 
browser sends a request to the webserver that hosts our website
'I want to see the home page'
webserver takes request processes it and return a response back to the client
this data exchange is defined by a protocol 
this browser sends a HTTP request to the server
how should we respond to clients???
we use HTML for representing webpages
generate page on the server or let client create the page

Server provides an API all thhings we use to interact
API two different software's to communicate and exchange data with each other.
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code. 
When we want to receive data from an API, we need to make a request. Requests are used all over the web. For instance,
 when you visited this blog post, your web browser made a request to the Dataquest web server, which responded with the content of this web page.

 Use Django to build our software
The Django REST Framework (DRF) is a package built on top of Django to create web APIs.
Django is an API
